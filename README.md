team three group task 2 

We are going to use an ArrayList and then add all the values using the .add method.
To remove the duplicates we created a method called removed dups that returns an ArrayList and has an input of an ArrayList.
  For that method it creates a new ArrayList inside the method and uses a for loop and an if statement the for loop goes through every item in the list and the if statements checks if the new list
  contains the item.contain method and if it doesnt contain it it uses the .add method to add it to the ArrayList 
For the reverse list we created a ner ArrayList and we used the stack reverse using a for and while loop and the stack.push and stack.pop methods 
Then we have the output staements to push and shows the results of the methods that we used.
